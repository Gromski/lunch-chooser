# Deprecation Warnings - Notes

This document tracks known deprecation warnings and their resolution status.

## Resolved ✅

The following warnings have been addressed via npm `overrides` in `package.json`:
- `glob@7.2.3` → Overridden to `glob@^10.0.0`
- `rimraf@3.0.2` → Overridden to `rimraf@^5.0.0`
- `inflight@1.0.6` → Resolved by updating parent dependencies

## Known/Accepted Warnings ⚠️

The following warnings are expected and cannot be resolved at this time:

1. **`eslint@8.57.1`**: This version is required by `eslint-config-next@^14.2.0` (Next.js 14). ESLint 9 uses a different configuration format (flat config) that Next.js doesn't support yet. This will be resolved when Next.js updates to support ESLint 9.

2. **`@humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0`** and **`@humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3`**: These are transitive dependencies of ESLint 8's configuration system. They will be automatically updated when ESLint is upgraded.

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor Next.js updates for ESLint 9 support
- [ ] Update ESLint configuration when Next.js supports ESLint 9
- [ ] Review and update overrides as dependencies evolve
